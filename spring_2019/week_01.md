## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Got accostumed to Github and my group created an organization for every member in the Technical Professionalism project and we each now have a separate repository.

## This Week's Plan

> My plan this week is to preview another HTML resume to become more familiar with the language and its intricacies, such as braces and tags, to witness which commands impact the visual. 

## Anything Blocking?

> Since we are just getting started, we do not have any blockers in the project yet.

## Notes
