## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I reviewed the document and the first lession plan that Milena posted.

## This Week's Plan

> I am looking forward to commit my first code this week, hopefully by Friday.

## Anything Blocking?

> On SIS, the full name of my project is not shown. Instead it displays "RCOS - Technical Professionali" because I believe the name cannot be longer than 30 characters, so there is some type of cap.

## Notes

> We had a large group on Tuesday and have a small group on Friday.
> Signup for OSSN to be part of a more global open source community.
> I still need to attend a Bonus Session this semester.
> I also need to remember to push this update.
